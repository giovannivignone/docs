title: Token Oversupply by Repayment Without Burn
---

If the contract uses tokens to track user balances/debts, the corresponding tokens should be burned to prevent an unbacked oversupply of the underlying tokens. Without burning these tokens, the contractâ€™s circulating tokens and underlying collateral may become unbalanced. This can lead to severe economic consequences for the protocol.

Octane will detect and flag whenever a contract uses tokens to track user balances/debts, but does not burn the corresponding tokens.
