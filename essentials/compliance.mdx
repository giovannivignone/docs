Understanding how your smart contracts stack up to industry security best practices is incredibly important, but often also incredibly difficult.

Luckily, there’s a new standard for smart contract security best practices, created by some of the most respected security names in the space, including Quantstamp, OpenZeppelin, ConsenSys, Hacken, and more. It’s called [EthTrust](https://entethalliance.github.io/eta-registry/security-levels-spec.html).

Octane’s Compliance Engine is the fastest way to find out what you need to fix to fully meet these industry best practices.

Better yet, whenever Octane’s Compliance Engine detects an issue with your code, Octane’s Code Fix Engine kicks into gear to suggest a draft fix that, when implemented, will move you one check mark closer to being fully compliant with security best practices.

Finally, when your code meets all of the [EthTrust](https://entethalliance.github.io/eta-registry/security-levels-spec.html) guidelines through Octane’s Compliance Engine, you’ll be given Octane’s EthTrust Compliance Certification. This can be provided to stakeholders including users, DAO members, investors, and more to show your commitment to security and compliance with industry best practices.
