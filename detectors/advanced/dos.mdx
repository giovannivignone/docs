title: 'Denial of Service'
---

Denial of Service (DoS) errors occur when a contract is rendered unable to perform its intended operations, either due to excessive gas costs, logic that leads to infinite loops, and conditions that consistently cause transactions to revert. These errors smart contracts can severely impact functionality and reliability.

Octane identifies logic that may lead to unrecoverable states, or which may allow a malicious actor to block other usersâ€™ ability to properly interact with the smart contract.
