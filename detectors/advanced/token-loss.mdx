title: 'Token Loss'
---

Octaneâ€™s simulated attackers will seek to steal funds from the smart contract, and send them to a controllable address.

If an attacker is able to drain funds from the underlying smart contract, whether ETH or another token, Octane will flag this as a vulnerability and give a digestible step-by-step breakdown of how the attacker was able to steal the contract funds.

Octane will also provide a natural description using the Attack Simulation Explanation Engine of how this attack occurred so that the team is able to effectively understand what caused the simulated attacker to steal contract funds (in the simulation environment).
