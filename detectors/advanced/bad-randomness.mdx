title: 'Bad Randomness'
---

Octane will detect poor uses of randomness, especially those that can be guessed by external entities, predicted by a dedicated malicious actor, or influenced by miners or bundlers.

Octane pays particular attention to the use of block attributes like number or timestamp as a proxy for such randomness, and will also flag poor uses of popular randomness providers.
