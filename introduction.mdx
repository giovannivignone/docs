## Compliance Engine

Understanding how your smart contracts stack up to industry security best practices is vitally important, especially as smart contracts become increasingly more complex. Octane's Compliance Engine lets you measure how your smart contracts stack up to the EthTrust standard, showing what you need to fix, and even suggesting these fixes in order to become more compliant.
