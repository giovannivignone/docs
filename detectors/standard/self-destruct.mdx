Unsafe Use of Self-Destruct

###

Octane generally recommends against the use of selfdestruct() instruction or its now-deprecated alias suicide() as it can potentially allow malicious code to destroy a contract and steal any Ether held by the contract.

Users interacting with the smart contract will find that transfer calls to the destroyed contract donâ€™t revert, instead their tokens suddenly disappear as ether sent to the destroyed contract is lost forever.

Octane will detect such unsafe use of self-destruct. This detection can be overridden if the call is carefully protected and can only be called by authorized users.
