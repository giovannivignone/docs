title: 'Use of Assembly'
---

Octane will flag any uses of low-level assembly by the smart contract.

Low-level assembly use is not itself a vulnerability, but in general is a best practice to avoid unless carefully audited. Use of assembly also violates the lowest level of the EthTrust standard, though may be safe if the development team has sufficiently reviewed the assembly in question and has determined that the assembly use is operationally necessary for the contract or its users.
