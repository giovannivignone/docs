title: 'Attacker-Invokable Self-Destruct'
---

Octaneâ€™s simulated attackers will seek to self-destruct the smart contract in simulated environment, and do so while specifying an address they control.

If an attacker is able to invoke and control the direction of funds from a self-destruct, Octane will flag this as a vulnerability and give a detailed step-by-step breakdown.

Octane will also provide a natural description using the Attack Simulation Explanation Engine of how this attack occurred so that your team is able to effectively understand what caused the simulated attacker to self-destruct and/or profit from the self-destruction.
