Octane is best suited to secure teams who build smart contracts. Our detectors specialize in finding interesting DeFi vulnerabilities, but can be tuned for protocols in other categories like gaming and account abstraction.

Teams gearing up for an audit will find the most immediate value from Octane. By using our detection engines proactively, you can incentivize the audit firm/contest platform to focus on the most hard-to-catch vulnerabilities, squeezing much more value from every dollar you spend on security.

Through the development process and after an audit, teams find value from Octane’s vulnerability detectors as they continue to learn and tackle new vulnerabilities. We frequently push updates with new detectors for hard-to-catch, often critical, frequently auditor-missed vulnerabilities including Rounding Errors, Fund Lock Vulnerabilities, Denial of Service conditions, and especially tricky Oracle Misconfigurations.

Integrating Octane is like having a security researcher on retainer who’s continually skilling up and constantly hunting for new issues in your code. Even if your code doesn’t change, the threat landscape will, and our detectors will be able to flag new issues as they become increasingly capable.
