title: 'Unchecked Return Values'
---

Octane will detect whenever a contract neglects to properly check the return value of an external call.

While some methods like address.transfer() do revert execution if the call fails, other methods like address.send() don’t revert on failure, but instead return true/false and allow execution to proceed.

Yet other methods like call() return a tuple (bool, bytes memory), which indicates whether the call was successful. Because this doesn’t revert if the call fails, it’s important to check the return value with a require, if, or assert.
