title: Incorrectly Payable
---

An Incorrectly Payable vulnerability occurs when a specific function is marked with the payable modifier, allowing it to receive tokens, despite the fact that the function does not handle these incoming transactions.

These tokens can sometimes be arbitrarily forwarded, and can cause users to permanently lose funds if the balance they send isnâ€™t properly accounted for in the protocol.

Octane will detect and flag whenever a function is marked as payable but does not have the proper logic to handle incoming token transfers.
