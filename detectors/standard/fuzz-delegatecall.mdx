title: 'Attacker-Controlled DelegateCall'
---

Octaneâ€™s simulated attackers will set up a malicious smart contract, and seek to delegatecall to this address.

If an attacker is able to take control of the execution logic, Octane will flag this as a vulnerability and give a digestible step-by-step breakdown of how the attacker was able to hijack control flow.

Octane will also provide a natural description using the Attack Simulation Explanation Engine of how this attack occurred so that the team is able to effectively understand what caused the simulated attacker to delegatecall to their created malicious contract.
