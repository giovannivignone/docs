title: 'Property Violation'
---

Octaneâ€™s simulated attackers will go through a two-step process of grokking and subsequently seeking to break any properties specified via standard echidna property tests.

If an attacker is able to violate a property on the smart contract, Octane will flag this as a vulnerability and give a detailed step-by-step breakdown.

Octane will also provide a natural description using the Attack Simulation Explanation Engine of how the attacker was able to violate the property, helping your team to more effectively understand what led to the property violation and how to fix it.
