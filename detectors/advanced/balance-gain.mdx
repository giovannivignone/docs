title: 'Attacker Balance Gain'
---

Octane’s simulated attackers will seek to steal funds from benign users in the simulated fork environment.

If any attacker is able to steal significant funds from another user, Octane will flag this as a vulnerability in the smart contract, and give a digestible step-by-step breakdown of how the attacker was able to steal the user’s funds.

Octane will also provide a natural description using the Attack Simulation Explanation Engine of how this attack occurred so that the team is able to effectively understand what caused the simulated user to have their funds stolen.
