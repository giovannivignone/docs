title: 'Reentrancy'
---

Famously the error that took down the DAO, and has taken down a great many protocols since.

Reentrancy allows an attacker to seize control flow and re-invoke your code before the flow you expect is finished executing, often bypassing important safety logic or modifying state multiple times in the process.

Octane checks for violations of the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. We define these as

- **Check**: Ensure conditions (e.g., **'require()'** statements) are met.
- **Effects**: Update any state variables necessary.
- **Interactions**: Make external calls or send ether last.

Octane also deploys trained simulated attackers that search for such reentrancy vulnerabilities, notifying you if a simulated attacker is able to maliciously reenter smart contracts in your repository.

Octane specifically designates those violations that are most likely to lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.
